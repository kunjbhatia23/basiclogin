I designed a responsive Sign-In Page using HTML and CSS for my college assignment.
The page features a clean layout with a logo, a welcome message, and cards showcasing benefits like device synchronization, 
enhanced security, and data protection. A notification card highlights organizational device management. The design includes 
a visually appealing background, interactive buttons with hover effects, and a responsive layout using flexbox and box shadows. 
This project reflects my skills in creating user-friendly and functional web pages.
